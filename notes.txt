We have bought a new fridge a year ago on may 22 2023, It was running smooth without any problems, until one day an lg service guy called us and said he would add a new part for the refrigerator on 7 may 2024 and he came on 12 may 2024, but he cut the gas pipe of the refrigerator by mistake, since it is their fault and we had a warranty since it has not been a year, so we have asked for a fridge replacement, but they did not do it and stalled us for more than 30 days and came and repaired it which we were not satisfied with, and few days later, there is a gas leakage and the refrigerator is not working, The company itself called us and made this message and we lost our fridge , We need a replacement asap, since we have been contacting our local service centre , but they are giving contacts of each other and forwarding the call to each other, without any proper progress, This has been happening since the first call and it has been nearly 40 days without a proper response, We do not accept a repair again , because it would raise problems in the future and we only accept a replacement of the refrigerator, So I sincerely hope you sanction this new refrigerator replacement as soon as possible, Thank you
